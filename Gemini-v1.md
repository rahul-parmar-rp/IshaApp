# Yoga Session Scheduler: Application Scope & Documentation

1. Application Purpose
The Yoga Session Scheduler is a smart, personalized utility designed to help yoga practitioners create a structured and appropriate yoga session based on their available time and the specific practices they have learned. It aims to simplify the process of planning a yoga routine by offering intelligent suggestions that adhere to traditional sequencing principles.

2. Core Functionality
At its heart, the application allows a user to specify how much time they have for their yoga practice. In response, it generates a list of suitable yoga session combinations, guiding the user to a well-structured and time-efficient routine.

3. Key Features
The application provides the following functionalities to enhance the user's experience:

My Learned Practices:

Users can easily select and deselect from a comprehensive list of yoga practices to indicate which ones they have personally learned.

This ensures that all suggestions and manual additions are tailored exclusively to the user's known repertoire, making the recommendations highly relevant.

Smart Session Suggestions (Automated Combinations):

Upon entering the desired session duration, the application automatically generates a list of possible yoga session combinations.

These suggestions are intelligently crafted to fit within the specified time.

Respects Traditional Flow: The suggestions adhere to established yoga sequencing rules. For example:

If 'Guru Pooja' is a learned practice, every suggested session will begin with it, honoring its traditional role as an invocation.

If 'Savasana' (Corpse Pose) is included in a session, it will always be placed at the very end, serving as a proper cool-down and integration.

General practice categories (like Warm-up, Pranayama, Kriya, Meditation, Asana, Cool-down) follow a logical progression, ensuring a balanced and effective flow.

No Repetitions: Each practice will appear only once within any given suggested session, providing diverse and meaningful combinations.

Optimized for Time: Suggestions are prioritized to best utilize the available time, with combinations that closely match the duration appearing first.

Users can easily select any suggested combination to load it into their current session.

Manual Session Building:

For users who prefer to build their session step-by-step, the application provides individual buttons for each of their learned practices.

Users can add practices one by one, with the application validating in real-time if the practice:

Is a learned practice.

Fits within the remaining time.

Maintains the correct sequence based on the last practice added.

Has not already been added to the current session.

AI-Powered Assistance (Gemini Integration):

A dedicated "✨ Get AI Suggestion" button allows the user to leverage artificial intelligence for a personalized recommendation.

The AI analyzes the current session (if any), the remaining time, and the user's learned practices to suggest one additional complementary practice.

The AI's suggestion also respects the sequencing rules and aims to fit well within the available time.

Session Overview:

The application continuously displays the total time accumulated in the current session and the remaining time available, providing clear feedback to the user.

The current session's practices are listed clearly for easy review.

User Guidance & Feedback:

Custom pop-up messages are used to provide clear and concise feedback to the user, such as warnings if a practice cannot be added due to time constraints or sequencing rules, or if no suitable suggestions can be found.

1. Benefits to the User
Personalized Experience: Focuses only on practices the user has learned, making suggestions highly relevant and actionable.

Time Efficiency: Quickly generates sessions that fit perfectly into busy schedules.

Structured Practice: Ensures yoga routines follow a logical and beneficial sequence, even for those new to self-practice.

Reduced Decision Fatigue: Eliminates the guesswork of "what to do next" or "what fits in this time."

Enhanced Learning: Reinforces proper sequencing and encourages a holistic approach to yoga practice.

Flexibility: Offers both automated suggestions and manual building options to suit different user preferences.

1. Application Scope (What it is, and isn't)
This application is designed as a yoga session planning and recommendation tool.

It IS: A utility for generating personalized, time-boxed, and sequence-aware yoga practice combinations.

It IS NOT: A platform for guided yoga instruction (e.g., no videos, audio, or pose demonstrations), a full yoga studio management system, or a social networking platform for yoga practitioners. Its primary purpose is intelligent session scheduling.
